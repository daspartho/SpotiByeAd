No one likes interruptions! Don't you hate it when you're listening to your favorite jazz track or your EDM playlist and an ad for Old Spice or Pepsi starting playing interrupting your mood? With SpotiByeAds, you can listen ad-free allowing you to concentrating less on those ads and more towards the task at hand!

# How it works?
SpotiByeAds or SBA for short utilizes the SpotiPy and Pynput Libraries as well as the os system modules in order to provide you with a ad free experience.  First, it asks you for your Spotify Username, Client ID and Client Password(which is done by running ```python main.py ```). Of course if you've used this program and have saved credentials, it should load a json file with your credentials in it and if not, it will ask for your credentials(credentials being your Spotify Username, Client ID and Client Password). Note that for your first time, you have the option of either saving your credentials for future use or keeping your credentials just for this session of using SBA.

After SBA has your credentials, it will establish a connection with Spotify by restarting it and setting it to your last known track/playlist. When a ad enters your spotify queue, SBA will detect the current track as a ad and move to restart it. After the restart, SBA will automatically queue up your last track!

# Requirements

# Building
## MacOS / Linux 
If you'd like to build for Mac / Linux, do the following:
1. To build in a development environment (to make sure it works right), run `python setup.py py2app -A`. Please note: This builds the app in something called *alias mode*. This is NOT a proper build, and will only work on the machine it was run on.
2. To build a proper package, run `python setup.py py2app`.
