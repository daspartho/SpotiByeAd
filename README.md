# SpotiByeAds

No one likes interruptions! right? So this program detects when an advertisement plays by monitoring the type of the track that is currently playing, using the Spotipy API.
When an ad is detected, the program restarts Spotify by the os module and plays it via pynput, which skips the ad and starts right where you left off.

### Installation

git clone https://github.com/daspartho/SpotiByeAds.git

4. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret and paste it in the corresponding place holders in main.py.
5. Spotify's path with be automatically detected, but if you would like to override it or if the auto detection fails, paste the path to the spotify application on your computer in the PATH placeholder in main.py.
